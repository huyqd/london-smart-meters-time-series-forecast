    "### Traditional Seasonal Decomposition\n",
    "\n",
    "Seasonal decomposition is a fundamental technique in time series analysis that separates a time series into three main components:\n",
    "1. **Trend**: The long-term progression of the series, representing the underlying direction.\n",
    "2. **Seasonality**: The repeating patterns or cycles within a fixed period.\n",
    "3. **Residual**: The remaining variation after removing the trend and seasonality, often referred to as noise or irregularity.\n",
    "\n",
    "This decomposition can be expressed mathematically as:\n",
    "- **Additive Model**: $y_t = T_t + S_t + R_t$\n",
    "- **Multiplicative Model**: $y_t = T_t \\times S_t \\times R_t$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $y_t$ is the observed value at time $ t $, $ T_t $ is the trend component, $ S_t $ is the seasonal component, and $ R_t $ is the residual component.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Extracting the Trend Component\n",
    "The trend component $ T_t $ is typically estimated using a **moving average**. A moving average smooths the time series by averaging values over a fixed window, helping to remove short-term fluctuations and highlight the long-term trend.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a centered moving average with a window size $ k $, the trend at time $ t $ is computed as:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "T_t = \\frac{1}{k} \\sum_{i=-\\frac{k-1}{2}}^{\\frac{k-1}{2}} y_{t+i}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Here, $ k $ is often chosen to match the periodicity of the data (e.g., 12 for monthly data with yearly seasonality).\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if the data has a daily seasonality with 48 half-hourly observations per day, a moving average with a window size of 48 can be used to compute the trend.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Extracting the Seasonal Component\n",
    "Once the trend $ T_t $ is estimated, the seasonal component $ S_t $ can be computed by removing the trend from the original series and averaging the detrended values for each period.\n",
    "\n",
    "For an additive model:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "S_t = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{j=1}^{n} (y_{t+jp} - T_{t+jp})\n",
    "$$\n",
    "For a multiplicative model:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "S_t = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{j=1}^{n} \\frac{y_{t+jp}}{T_{t+jp}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Here, $ p $ is the period of seasonality (e.g., 48 for daily seasonality), and $ n $ is the number of complete cycles in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The seasonal component is computed separately for each time point within the period (e.g., for each half-hour in a day), and the resulting seasonal values are repeated across the entire time series.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Computing the Residual Component\n",
    "Finally, the residual component $ R_t $ is obtained by subtracting the trend and seasonal components from the original series:\n",
    "- For an additive model: $ R_t = y_t - T_t - S_t $\n",
    "- For a multiplicative model: $ R_t = \\frac{y_t}{T_t \\times S_t} $\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Full Workflow\n",
    "1. Compute the trend using a moving average.\n",
    "2. Subtract the trend from the original series to get the detrended series.\n",
    "3. Compute the seasonal component by averaging the detrended values for each period.\n",
    "4. Subtract the trend and seasonal components from the original series to get the residual."

    "#### When to Use Seasonally Adjusted Data vs. Extracted Seasonal Components\n",
    "\n",
    "**Seasonally adjusted data** is obtained by removing the estimated seasonal component from the original time series. This is useful when you want to analyze or model the underlying trend and irregular fluctuations without the influence of recurring seasonal patterns. Typical use cases include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Trend Analysis:** To study long-term changes or structural breaks in the data without seasonal noise.\n",
    "- **Regression Modeling:** When building models to explain or forecast the underlying process, removing seasonality can improve model accuracy and interpretability.\n",
    "- **Anomaly Detection:** Outliers and unusual events are easier to detect in seasonally adjusted data, as regular seasonal effects have been removed.\n",
    "- **Comparing Across Time:** Seasonally adjusted values allow for meaningful comparisons between different periods, unaffected by predictable seasonal swings.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Extracted seasonal components** are used when the focus is on understanding, visualizing, or modeling the seasonal patterns themselves. Use cases include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Seasonality Analysis:** To quantify and interpret the strength, timing, and nature of recurring cycles (e.g., daily, weekly, yearly).\n",
    "- **Feature Engineering:** Incorporating seasonal indices as features in machine learning models to capture periodic effects.\n",
    "- **Forecasting:** When future seasonal effects need to be explicitly modeled or projected, the extracted seasonal component can be added back to trend and residual forecasts.\n",

This flexibility allows STL to better capture real-world variations in household behavior.\n",

    "### MSTL: Multiple Seasonal-Trend Decomposition using LOESS\n",
    "\n",
    "While STL is powerful for decomposing a time series into trend, seasonality, and residual components, it is limited to a **single seasonal period**. However, many real-world time series—such as electricity demand, web traffic, or retail sales—exhibit **multiple seasonal patterns** (e.g., daily and weekly cycles).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is MSTL?\n",
    "\n",
    "**MSTL** (Multiple Seasonal-Trend decomposition using LOESS) is an extension of STL that allows for the decomposition of time series with **multiple seasonalities**. MSTL iteratively applies STL to extract several seasonal components, each with its own period.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mathematical Formulation\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a time series $y_t$, MSTL decomposes it as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "y_t = T_t + S^{(1)}_t + S^{(2)}_t + \\cdots + S^{(K)}_t + R_t\n",
    "$$\n",

    "- $T_t$ is the **trend** component,\n",
    "- $S^{(k)}_t$ is the $k$-th **seasonal** component (e.g., daily, weekly),\n",
    "- $R_t$ is the **remainder** (residual) component,\n",
    "- $K$ is the number of seasonalities.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### MSTL Algorithm (High-Level Steps)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initial Trend Estimation**:  \n",
    "    Estimate the trend $T_t$ using LOESS smoothing.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Iterative Seasonal Extraction**:  \n",
    "    For each seasonal period $p_k$:\n",
    "    - Remove the current estimate of the trend and all other seasonal components from $y_t$.\n",
    "    - Apply STL to the detrended series to estimate $S^{(k)}_t$.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Update Trend**:  \n",
    "    After extracting all seasonal components, update the trend estimate using the seasonally adjusted series.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Repeat**:  \n",
    "    Iterate steps 2–3 until convergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Compute Residual**:  \n",
    "    $$\n",
    "    R_t = y_t - T_t - \\sum_{k=1}^K S^{(k)}_t\n",

    "### Measuring the Strength of Decomposed Components\n",
    "\n",
    "The strength of each decomposed component (trend, seasonality, and residual) can be quantified based on their variation. This provides an objective measure of how much each component contributes to the overall time series, as opposed to relying solely on visual inspection.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mathematical Formulation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Trend Strength**:  \n",
    "    The strength of the trend component is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "    \\text{Trend Strength} = \\max\\left(0, 1 - \\frac{\\text{Var}(R_t)}{\\text{Var}(T_t + R_t)}\\right)\n",

    "\n",
    "Fourier decomposition is a powerful approach for modeling and extracting seasonal patterns in time series data, especially when the seasonality is complex or involves multiple overlapping cycles. Instead of estimating the seasonal component by averaging or smoothing, Fourier decomposition represents seasonality as a sum of sine and cosine functions with different frequencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Fourier Series Representation:**  \n",
    "    Any periodic function can be approximated by a sum of sine and cosine terms (Fourier series). For a time series with period $p$, the seasonal component $S_t$ can be modeled as:\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "    S_t = \\sum_{k=1}^{K} \\left[ a_k \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi k t}{p}\\right) + b_k \\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi k t}{p}\\right) \\right]\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "    where $K$ is the number of harmonics (pairs of sine and cosine terms), and $a_k$, $b_k$ are coefficients estimated from the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Multiple Seasonalities:**  \n",
    "    By including Fourier terms for different periods (e.g., daily and weekly), the model can capture multiple seasonal patterns simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Estimation:**  \n",
    "    The coefficients of the Fourier terms are typically estimated using linear regression, often after removing the trend from the series (detrending). This allows for flexible and efficient modeling of seasonality.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Advantages\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Flexibility:**  Fourier terms can approximate a wide range of seasonal patterns, including those that are not strictly constant over time.\n",
    "- **Handles Multiple Seasonalities:**  Easily incorporates multiple seasonal cycles by adding terms for each relevant period.\n",
    "- **Smoothness:**  The resulting seasonal component is smooth and continuous, avoiding abrupt changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Detrend the Series:** Remove the trend component (e.g., using LOESS or moving average).\n",
    "2. **Generate Fourier Terms:** Create sine and cosine features for each seasonal period and harmonic.\n",
    "3. **Fit Regression:** Regress the detrended series on the Fourier terms to estimate the seasonal component.\n",
    "4. **Compute Residuals:** The remaining variation after removing trend and seasonality is the residual component.\n",
    "\n",

    "The seasonal component from the Fourier decomposition is often **weaker** (explains less variance) than that from MSTL or STL for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Model Flexibility**:  \n",
    "    - **STL/MSTL** use LOESS smoothing, which can adapt to changes in seasonal patterns over time (non-stationary seasonality).\n",
    "    - **Fourier decomposition** assumes the seasonal pattern is strictly periodic and constant over time (stationary), represented as a sum of fixed sine/cosine waves.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Number of Harmonics**:  \n",
    "    - The number of Fourier terms (`k`) limits the complexity of the seasonal pattern that can be captured. If `k` is too small, only simple, smooth seasonality is modeled.\n",
    "    - STL/MSTL can capture more complex, irregular, or evolving seasonal shapes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Multiple Seasonalities**:  \n",
    "    - MSTL can extract multiple seasonal components (e.g., daily and weekly) simultaneously and adaptively.\n",
    "    - Fourier decomposition can model multiple seasonalities, but only if you explicitly include enough terms for each period and harmonics.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Fitting Method**:  \n",
    "    - Fourier decomposition typically uses linear regression, which may not fit the seasonal pattern as closely as the iterative, robust smoothing in STL/MSTL.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Summary:**  \n",
    "- If the true seasonality is complex, non-stationary, or changes over time, STL/MSTL will generally capture more of the seasonal variation than a fixed Fourier basis with limited harmonics.\n",
    "- To improve the Fourier fit, you can increase the number of harmonics (`k`), but this may lead to overfitting or still not match the flexibility of STL/MSTL.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In practice:**  \n",
    "- Use STL/MSTL for adaptive, robust decomposition.\n",
    "- Use Fourier terms for simple, stationary, or parametric seasonal modeling (e.g., in regression or forecasting models like Prophet)."
